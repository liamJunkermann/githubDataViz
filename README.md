# SWENG DATA VIZ

To run you must use the `yarn` to install needed dependencies (`npm install` should also work, but this project was built using yarn and some dependencies might load differently). Once `yarn` has completed `yarn run` can be used to run the development version of the data visualisation.

## Building the docker container
In order to build the docker container, simply run `docker build .`. This will build an image which will serve the application on port 3000.
